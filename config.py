# chars to use when drawing ASCII, you may have to adjust them for your video. the chars go in brightness order
# some preset ones are below:

# CHARS = " =+*#%@"
CHARS = "@%#*+= "


FONT = "C:/font/path/here"  # path of the font you want to use, mono fonts work best

SCALE = 1  # how many pixels wide each character represents  - use 1 for a small video but use 16+ for a bigger video. dont make this number too small otherwise the code will take forever

FONT_SIZE = 16  # the size of the font in pixels - i recommend 16 but feel free to mess around with it
